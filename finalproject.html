        <p class="card-text">This project will analyize the geographical destribution of teachers who were trained at the Oswego Primary Teachers Training School, more commonly known as the Oswego Normal School, NY, in the late 19th tcentury. The intended audience is education historians. Hisotorians of American education have argued that many women in the East in the mid- to late 19th century traveled to the West to teach. The Oswego Normal School, founded in 1961, is among the teacher training schools that contributed to this trend. The scholarship tend to tell the story of the New England and New York women in general who migrated to the frontier, and has paid less attention to the geographic distribution of the graduates of a specific school. From the graduates of certain schools in the East, how many migrated to the West (or South) and how many remained in the East? And how many left the United States? Did the pattern change over time? This project seeks to add nuance to the body of research on 19th century teacher migration by answering these questions with geovisualization using the Oswego Normal School as a case site.</p>
