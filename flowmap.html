        <p class="card-text">For the flow symbol, I chose the black curved path with half-arrow; Koylu & Guo (2017) argue that in origin-destination flow maps, this is an effective symbol for quickly and accurately reading the magnitude and direction of the flows. If there are too many flows, they will overlap each other and become difficult to distinguish, so I initially limited the number to 50, but this resulted in not a single flow heading to California, where the net flow is very large. Therefore, I gradually increased the number of flows and set the number at 100, which is when the flows to California appeared. Koylu, Tian & Windosr (2022) point out that node symbols are not necessary to visualize flows between states, but I used them because I thought node symbols would help reveal states with a lot of people moving in and out. In choropleth mapping, I used a diverging color scheme in which states with negative net flows are blue and states with positive net flows are red, making it easier for the reader to intuitively read the overall spatial patterns. For the classification method, I used natural breaks for objectivity.</p>
        <p class="card-text">Overall, the flows are concentrated in the Midwest and South. There is significant family migration between neighboring states, but the overall trend is toward east-to-west migration. The Midwest receives and sends more flows, but net flows are largely negative. Opposite to this are Texas and Oklahoma. These two states also receive and send a lot of flows, but their net flows are positive. California is exclusively a family influx state, but the total flow is not so large. The time period covered by this project covers the beginning of the great migration of African Americans from the South to the North and Midwest, but the impact of this migration is not clear in this data. </p>
